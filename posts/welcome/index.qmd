## Problem

Nitrate supports aquatic life at natural levels but in excess drives algal blooms and hypoxia. Managers need a **quick way** to know *when* nitrate spikes and whether **routine sensors** (conductivity, turbidity, dissolved oxygen, temperature, stage) can stand in for expensive nitrate probes.

This post **recasts my Assignment 2 analysis** into an accessible summary: one clear figure, one compact table, and a practical takeaway.


## Analysis

**Data source.** NEON river sites Arikaree (CO), Caribou (AK), Lewis Run (VA); nitrate by **SUNA V2** (~15-min), with routine sensors at similar cadence.

**Approach** In A2 I fitted **GAMMs** linking nitrate to routine sensors and time structure. For the blog: one clear **figure** + one **table** and what they mean.


```{r}
#| label: fig-nitrate
#| fig-cap: "Nitrate contrasts by site (median, µM)."
#| echo: false
library(ggplot2)

# data 
med <- data.frame(
  site = c("Arikaree (CO)","Caribou (AK)","Lewis Run (VA)"),
  nitrate_median_uM = c(5.5, 28.4, 192.0)
)

# on-brand colours
violet  <- "#8b5cf6"
fuchsia <- "#d946ef"
ink     <- "#1f1636"   # axis/text colour
panel   <- "#fde7f5"   # soft blush panel
grid    <- "#ffffff66" # light grid

ggplot(med, aes(x = reorder(site, nitrate_median_uM),
                y = nitrate_median_uM)) +
  geom_segment(aes(xend = site, y = 0, yend = nitrate_median_uM),
               linewidth = 2.2, colour = violet, alpha = .85) +
  geom_point(size = 6, colour = "white",
             fill = fuchsia, shape = 21, stroke = 2) +
  geom_text(aes(label = nitrate_median_uM),
            vjust = -0.9, size = 4, colour = ink) +
  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0, max(med$nitrate_median_uM) * 1.12)) +
  labs(x = NULL, y = "Median nitrate (µM)") +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 13) +
  theme(
    panel.background = element_rect(fill = panel, color = NA),
    plot.background  = element_rect(fill = "transparent", color = NA),
    panel.grid.major = element_line(color = grid),
    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
    axis.title       = element_text(color = ink),
    axis.text        = element_text(color = ink)
  )

```

Reading @fig-nitrate. Lewis Run’s median nitrate dwarfs the others; Caribou is low and steady; Arikaree is lower on median but more event-driven. This points to where risk is persistent and when to prioritise targeted sampling (e.g., post-rain windows).


```{r}
#| label: tbl-nitrate
#| tbl-cap: "Compact summary of site medians (µM), days measured, and share of total."
#| echo: false
#| message: false
#| warning: false
library(tibble)
library(dplyr)
library(scales)

violet <- "#8b5cf6"   
blush  <- "#fde7f5"   

tbl <- tibble(
  site          = c("Arikaree (CO)", "Caribou (AK)", "Lewis Run (VA)"),
  median_uM     = c(5.5, 28.4, 192.0),
  days_measured = c(120, 110, 118),
  pct_high_days = c(0.18, 0.05, 0.26)   
) |>
  mutate(share_of_total = median_uM / sum(median_uM)) |>
  transmute(
    Site = site,
    `Median (µM)`   = number(median_uM, accuracy = 0.1),
    `Days measured` = days_measured,
    `High days`     = percent(pct_high_days, accuracy = 1),
    `Share of total`= percent(share_of_total, accuracy = 1)
  )

#pretty table
if (requireNamespace("kableExtra", quietly = TRUE)) {
  knitr::kable(tbl, align = c("l","r","r","r","r")) |>
    kableExtra::kable_styling(full_width = FALSE, bootstrap_options = c("condensed","striped")) |>
    kableExtra::row_spec(0, background = blush, color = violet, bold = TRUE)
} else {
  knitr::kable(tbl, align = c("l","r","r","r","r"))
}


```


Reading @tbl-nitrate. The numbers mirror @fig-nitrate and support a targeted monitoring plan: keep routine sensors everywhere; add nitrate-specific effort at higher-risk sites/times.

Why routine sensors matter (A2). In my Assignment 2 models, a small, consistent set of routine variables captured most of the signal for nitrate; once temporal structure is included, fit was extremely high. That means managers can rely on calibrated routine sensors as a cost-effective backbone, using nitrate probes for calibration and hotspots.

## Conclusion

Short, event-driven nitrate episodes drive most risk. Use routine sensors everywhere, calibrate locally, and concentrate extra effort around likely peak windows. This communication-first summary complements the technical A2 report and aligns with literature showing nitrate can be inferred from routine variables across contrasting rivers [@kermorvant2023].
