Continuous nitrate sensors are accurate but expensive to purchase, maintain, and clean, so many monitoring programs rely on more affordable **routine sensors** (conductivity, turbidity, temperature, dissolved oxygen, and stage).\n\nThe practical questions are: **Can routine sensors, with local calibration, provide enough information to detect nitrate peaks and guide sampling timing?** And **where** are nitrate concentrations typically higher so limited effort can be targeted more effectively?\n\nThis post translates the technical analysis into a manager-friendly summary using one clear **figure** and one compact **table**.\n\n## ANALYSIS\n\n**Data source.**\n\nI analysed high-frequency stream records from three **NEON** sites: **Arikaree (CO)** (semi arid, event driven), **Caribou (AK)** (pristine, stable), and **Lewis Run (VA)** (urban agricultural, persistently higher). Nitrate was measured by **SUNA V2** at ~15-minute cadence, alongside routine sensors: specific conductance, turbidity, dissolved oxygen, temperature, and stage. I aligned timestamps to nitrate and removed values flagged by NEON QC. Units for this post are **mg/L as N** for clarity.\n\n**Approach** \n\nI fitted **GAMMs** to capture smooth, nonlinear links between nitrate and routine sensors while modelling temporal autocorrelation. For this blog, I compress the findings into one visual and one table: @fig-nitrate shows typical levels (medians, mg/L as N) by site; @tbl-nitrate adds coverage (days measured), “high day” proportions, and share of the total median. The goal is quick comprehension for decision makers rather than model details.\n\n\n**Findings.** \n\nTypical nitrate differs sharply across sites: **Lewis Run** is much higher on median, **Caribou** is consistently low, and **Arikaree** is lower on median but **spiky after rainfall** (event-driven behaviour). In my modelling, routine variables especially conductance, temperature, turbidity, and stage explained most nitrate variation once temporal structure was included, indicating that calibrated routine sensors can act as reliable proxies.\n\n\n**Design quality.** \n\nThe figure uses on-brand colours and direct value labels for quick scanning; the table keeps units visible, right aligns numbers for easy comparison, and limits to the few fields needed for decisions.\nLink back to the question. Together, @fig-nitrate and @tbl-nitrate show where nitrate is typically higher (Lewis Run) and when to concentrate effort (post rain windows at Arikaree), which is exactly what managers need to schedule sampling and alerts [@kermorvant2023].\n\n\nThe pair of visuals answers *when* and *where* to focus: persistent **higher background** at **Lewis Run** warrants ongoing nitrate checks; **post-rain windows** at **Arikaree** are the prime times for surge sampling; **Caribou’s** stability means routine sensors often suffice. This targeted strategy routine sensor backbone plus short, well timed nitrate measurements addresses the original problem efficiently and aligns with recent evidence that nitrate can be inferred from routine variables across contrasting rivers [@kermorvant2023].\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Nitrate contrasts by site (median, mg/L as N).](index_files/figure-html/fig-nitrate-1.png){#fig-nitrate width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n@fig-nitrate shows medians only (no clutter) so differences are obvious at a glance. On brand colours separate sites, value labels sit just above points, and axes are kept simple with units shown on the y-axis. A soft background panel improves contrast with the page while black axis/tick styling maintains readability.\n\n\n\n\n::: {#tbl-nitrate .cell tbl-cap='Compact summary of site medians (mg/L as N), days measured, and share of total.'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<table class=\"table table-condensed table-striped\" style=\"width: auto !important; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n <thead>\n  <tr>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;font-weight: bold;color: rgba(139, 92, 246, 255) !important;background-color: rgba(253, 231, 245, 255) !important;\"> Site </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;font-weight: bold;color: rgba(139, 92, 246, 255) !important;background-color: rgba(253, 231, 245, 255) !important;\"> Median (mg/L as N) </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;font-weight: bold;color: rgba(139, 92, 246, 255) !important;background-color: rgba(253, 231, 245, 255) !important;\"> Days measured </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;font-weight: bold;color: rgba(139, 92, 246, 255) !important;background-color: rgba(253, 231, 245, 255) !important;\"> High days </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;font-weight: bold;color: rgba(139, 92, 246, 255) !important;background-color: rgba(253, 231, 245, 255) !important;\"> Share of total </th>\n  </tr>\n </thead>\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Arikaree (CO) </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 0.077 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 120 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 18% </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 2% </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Caribou (AK) </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 0.398 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 110 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 5% </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 13% </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Lewis Run (VA) </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 2.689 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 118 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 26% </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 85% </td>\n  </tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n`````\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n@tbl-nitrate provides just the decision-relevant fields: median nitrate (with units), days measured (coverage), an easy “high-day” percentage, and the share of total. Numbers are right-aligned for scanning; headers include units; the caption is concise so readers know exactly what they’re looking at without hunting in the text.\n\n## CONCLUSION\n\nThis analysis shows clear site contrasts: Lewis Run has persistently higher nitrate, Caribou is low, and Arikaree is lower on median but spikes after rainfall. The visuals @fig-nitrate (medians in mg/L as N) and @tbl-nitrate (coverage, share, and “high-day” proportions) let managers see both where nitrate is typically higher and when to intensify effort. Practically, keep routine sensors at all sites and calibrate locally to nitrate; prioritise continuous nitrate checks at Lewis Run, and schedule post rain surge sampling at Arikaree. At Caribou, routine sensors will often suffice outside unusual events. These recommendations align with my modelling (routine variables explain most nitrate variation with temporal structure) and with recent literature that supports nitrate inference from routine sensors [@kermorvant2023]. Overall, a targeted monitoring strategy routine sensor backbone plus short, well-timed nitrate measurements delivers better information at lower cost and answers the original question.\n\nSee the palette gallery for options [@rcharts-colors].\n\nSee implementation notes in the AI discussion [@chatgpt-share].\n\n\n## GitHub pages \n\n<https://etc5523-2025.github.io/assignment-3-creating-a-blog-GirikaChopra/>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
