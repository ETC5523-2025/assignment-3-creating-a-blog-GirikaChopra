    "text": "Analysis\nData source. NEON river sites — Arikaree (CO), Caribou (AK), Lewis Run (VA); nitrate by SUNA V2 (~15-min), with routine sensors at similar cadence.\nApproach In A2 I fitted GAMMs linking nitrate to routine sensors and time structure. For the blog: one clear figure + one table and what they mean.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Nitrate contrasts by site (median, µM).\n\n\n\n\n\nReading Figure Figure 1. Lewis Run’s median nitrate dwarfs the others; Caribou is low and steady; Arikaree is lower on median but more event-driven. This points to where risk is persistent and when to prioritise targeted sampling (e.g., post-rain windows).\n\n\n\n\nTable 1: Compact summary of site medians (µM), days measured, and share of total.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSite\nMedian (µM)\nDays measured\nHigh days\nShare of total\n\n\n\n\nArikaree (CO)\n5.5\n120\n18%\n2%\n\n\nCaribou (AK)\n28.4\n110\n5%\n13%\n\n\nLewis Run (VA)\n192.0\n118\n26%\n85%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReading Table Table 1. The numbers mirror Figure Figure 1 and support a targeted monitoring plan: keep routine sensors everywhere; add nitrate-specific effort at higher-risk sites/times.\nWhy routine sensors matter (A2). In my Assignment 2 models, a small, consistent set of routine variables captured most of the signal for nitrate; once temporal structure is included, fit was extremely high. That means managers can rely on calibrated routine sensors as a cost-effective backbone, using nitrate probes for calibration and hotspots."

    "text": "Conclusion\nShort, event-driven nitrate episodes drive most risk. Use routine sensors everywhere, calibrate locally, and concentrate extra effort around likely peak windows. This communication-first summary complements the technical A2 report and aligns with literature showing nitrate can be inferred from routine variables across contrasting rivers (Kermorvant et al. 2023).\nbibliography: references.bib(Kermorvant et al. 2023)"
