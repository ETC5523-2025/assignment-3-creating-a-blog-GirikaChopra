    "section": "ANALYSIS",
    "text": "ANALYSIS\nData source.\nI analysed high-frequency stream records from three NEON sites: Arikaree (CO) (semi arid, event driven), Caribou (AK) (pristine, stable), and Lewis Run (VA) (urban agricultural, persistently higher). Nitrate was measured by SUNA V2 at ~15-minute cadence, alongside routine sensors: specific conductance, turbidity, dissolved oxygen, temperature, and stage. I aligned timestamps to nitrate and removed values flagged by NEON QC. Units for this post are mg/L as N for clarity.\nApproach\nI fitted GAMMs to capture smooth, nonlinear links between nitrate and routine sensors while modelling temporal autocorrelation. For this blog, I compress the findings into one visual and one table: Figure 1 shows typical levels (medians, mg/L as N) by site; Table 1 adds coverage (days measured), “high day” proportions, and share of the total median. The goal is quick comprehension for decision makers rather than model details.\nFindings.\nTypical nitrate differs sharply across sites: Lewis Run is much higher on median, Caribou is consistently low, and Arikaree is lower on median but spiky after rainfall (event-driven behaviour). In my modelling, routine variables especially conductance, temperature, turbidity, and stage explained most nitrate variation once temporal structure was included, indicating that calibrated routine sensors can act as reliable proxies.\nDesign quality.\nThe figure uses on-brand colours and direct value labels for quick scanning; the table keeps units visible, right aligns numbers for easy comparison, and limits to the few fields needed for decisions. Link back to the question. Together, Figure 1 and Table 1 show where nitrate is typically higher (Lewis Run) and when to concentrate effort (post rain windows at Arikaree), which is exactly what managers need to schedule sampling and alerts (Kermorvant et al. 2023).\nThe pair of visuals answers when and where to focus: persistent higher background at Lewis Run warrants ongoing nitrate checks; post-rain windows at Arikaree are the prime times for surge sampling; Caribou’s stability means routine sensors often suffice. This targeted strategy routine sensor backbone plus short, well timed nitrate measurements addresses the original problem efficiently and aligns with recent evidence that nitrate can be inferred from routine variables across contrasting rivers (Kermorvant et al. 2023).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Nitrate contrasts by site (median, mg/L as N).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1 shows medians only (no clutter) so differences are obvious at a glance. On brand colours separate sites, value labels sit just above points, and axes are kept simple with units shown on the y-axis. A soft background panel improves contrast with the page while black axis/tick styling maintains readability.\n\n\n\n\nTable 1: Compact summary of site medians (mg/L as N), days measured, and share of total.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSite\nMedian (mg/L as N)\nDays measured\nHigh days\nShare of total\n\n\n\n\nArikaree (CO)\n0.077\n120\n18%\n2%\n\n\nCaribou (AK)\n0.398\n110\n5%\n13%\n\n\nLewis Run (VA)\n2.689\n118\n26%\n85%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1 provides just the decision-relevant fields: median nitrate (with units), days measured (coverage), an easy “high-day” percentage, and the share of total. Numbers are right-aligned for scanning; headers include units; the caption is concise so readers know exactly what they’re looking at without hunting in the text."

    "section": "CONCLUSION",
    "text": "CONCLUSION\nThis analysis shows clear site contrasts: Lewis Run has persistently higher nitrate, Caribou is low, and Arikaree is lower on median but spikes after rainfall. The visuals Figure 1 (medians in mg/L as N) and Table 1 (coverage, share, and “high-day” proportions) let managers see both where nitrate is typically higher and when to intensify effort. Practically, keep routine sensors at all sites and calibrate locally to nitrate; prioritise continuous nitrate checks at Lewis Run, and schedule post rain surge sampling at Arikaree. At Caribou, routine sensors will often suffice outside unusual events. These recommendations align with my modelling (routine variables explain most nitrate variation with temporal structure) and with recent literature that supports nitrate inference from routine sensors (Kermorvant et al. 2023). Overall, a targeted monitoring strategy routine sensor backbone plus short, well-timed nitrate measurements delivers better information at lower cost and answers the original question.\nSee the palette gallery for options (R-charts 2025).\nSee implementation notes in the AI discussion (ChatGPT 2025)."

    "text": "Hi, I’m Girika, a Master of Business Analytics student at Monash University. I’m passionate about turning data into stories people can actually understand. I work with R, Quarto, Excel, GitHub, and the tidyverse, translating technical analyses into clear narratives that bring numbers to life. This blog turns a nitrate analysis into an accessible post for broader audiences because good insights deserve to be shared, not hidden in code chunks.\nI am especially interested in data communication, uncertainty, reproducibility and visualization. I love working with ggplot2 it’s colourful, creative and makes every chart feel like a little celebration of data. My workflow leans on version control, literate programming, and clean figure and table design with captions and cross-references to keep everything transparent and reproducible.\nBeyond the analytics world, I’m a big believer in balance. I love badminton and play almost every Sunday, often followed by a peaceful walk through parks and nature around Melbourne. I’m also a huge dog lover and I can’t wait to have my own pup here and spend weekends at dog events and meet ups. On the side, I explore photography and create simple, feel good content for fun.\nI currently work part time as an Associate, supporting prospective students with application preparation and documentation, maintaining accurate CRM records, coordinating timelines between students, institutions, and internal teams, and contributing to data driven insights for process improvements.I am an enthusiastic learner, curious explorer, and someone who truly enjoys the blend of logic, creativity, and a bit of chaos that analytics brings."
